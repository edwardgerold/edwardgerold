## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**edwardgerold/edwardgerold** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on WEB3 projects focused on decentralized finance (DeFi).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about AI (Artificial Intelligence) and its applications in data analysis.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with the WEB3 community on innovative blockchain solutions.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking assistance with software development, particularly in smart contract programming.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my experiences in WEB3 or the latest trends in AI.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at: @edwardgerold or connect with me on LinkedIn.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once built a simple ecommerce using blockchain technology!
